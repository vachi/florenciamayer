Mrs. Justa Cané Varela at the Historical Museum of San Isidro: Dr. Horacio Beccar 

Varela

These pieces are inspired by a great woman who lived in silent fortitude and who left a huge legate. Justa Cane Varela was the wife of Florencio Varela, one of our ancestors.They were both loved and appreciated for their great social and cultural commitment with the town and its people. I am grateful and proud for being one of their descendants.

Justa Cane Varela was the wife of Florencio Varela, one of our ancestors, and the mother of 

Maria Varela.

Maria Varela and her husband Cosme Beccar gave birth to the well known surname Beccar 

Varela. They were both loved and appreciated for their great social and cultural commitment 

with the town and its people. 

I am grateful and proud for being one of their descendants. I dedicate these pieces to the 

whole Beccar Varela family and to all those who work at the Museum who with such a 

dedication they achieve to mantain this great historical patrimony.

This house, where the Historical Museum functions, donated to the city by the generosity of 

my great grandfather Dr. Horacio Beccar Varela, for being a historial site, was once the home 

of Mrs. Mariquita Sanchez Thompson, a most remarkable and influential lady at the times of 

the independance. In fact, the argentine National Anthem was first sung at her house.
